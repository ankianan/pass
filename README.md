### Architecture
- Wallet: A key manager, that stores private/public key pair per identity per consumer.
  - Maintains a public endpoint to search set of registerd DIDs by user name   
- Identtiy: Each DID is an identity. 
  - One might want to maintain different identity on facebook and github.
- Consumer: Component encrypts/decrypt the content for set of users:
  - Can be browser extention, a CLI library or a dedicated App
- Relay: Component that allow consumer and wallet to communicate.

        - Yes, but WhatsApp encryption only works within WhatsApp and is not available to other platforms outside it.
  - Paid content
    - A GitHub repo hosting encrypted content restricting access to set of user or corporates. Good for montezing open source work by developer.
- What is the objective?  
  - To give back user control of their data and let them decide with whom to share.
